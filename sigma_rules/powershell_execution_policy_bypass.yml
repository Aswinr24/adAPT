description: 'Detects PowerShell execution with execution policy bypass (-ep bypass,
  -exec bypass, -executionpolicy bypass).

  APT29 uses execution policy bypass to run unsigned scripts without restrictions.

  This is commonly combined with -nop (no profile) and -noni (non-interactive) flags

  in their attack chain (e.g., "-nop -exec bypass -EncodedCommand").'
