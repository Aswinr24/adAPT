description: 'This rule monitors Windows Security Event ID 4720, which logs whenever
  a new local account is created.

  It alerts when the creator is an administrator-level account and the new account
  shows anomalous properties (e.g., password not set, disabled state, or created by
  built-in Administrator).'
